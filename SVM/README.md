this folder includes the implememtation of SVM in the primal form.
svm_implemement.py is the code for Problem 2, where sch_flag=1 is for 2(a) and sch_flag=2 is for 2(b);
svm_dual.py is the dual SVM code for Problem 3(a);
nonlinear_svm.py is the code of SVM with Gaussian kernal for Problem 3(a) and 3(b);
