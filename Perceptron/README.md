# Perceptron Implementations

This project contains implementations for three different types of Perceptron algorithms:

1. Standard Perceptron
2. Voted Perceptron
3. Average Perceptron

Each Perceptron variant is implemented in Python and can be used to train and evaluate a binary classifier on a provided dataset.

## Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You will also need the following Python packages:

- NumPy
- Pandas

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas
